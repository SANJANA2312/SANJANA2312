- # These are some quotes that I would like to mention, that I follow as my mantra of life:
  
- "Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it."
  ~~ *PATRICK MCKENZIE , Software Engineer*

- "The most successful people are those who are willing to take risks. The biggest risk you can take is to not take any risks."

- "Dream is not that you see while sleeping, dream is something which does not let you sleep."
  ~~ *A.P.J. ABDUL KALAM*

- Well there are quite a few, that I would like to mention here, but then it would become more of a philosophical kind of profile.😅

 # Last but not the least...
- Keep working hard, be kind, believe that there is some higher power always looking at us, chase your dreams, get successful...
- One day we all will get where we want...
- Between all the struggles and hardships of life , do not forget to enjoy that journey...
- # BECAUSE YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE!!
